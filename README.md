# Marlin-2.1.2-5--SKR-Mini-E3-V2
Marlin 2.1.2 5+ SKR Mini E3 V2


Ender 5 plus firmware with direct drive and SKR Mini E3 V2 and TFT35 3.0


Also, this is setup for a Microswiss direct drive and hot end. True and false formewares are supplied for your extruder direction. 

Homeing and acceleration are pumped up. Make sure to run Teching Tech's Input shaping tests to set your parameters. The speaker is enabled for the board as well.

My esteps and PID tune for the bed and hot end are in here. I highly recommend that you PID tune yours seperately along with calibrating your esteps.
